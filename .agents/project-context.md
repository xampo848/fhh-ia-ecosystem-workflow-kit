# Project Context

<!-- workflow-kit:project-context:template -->

Fixed knowledge base of this project for AI work. Discovery reads it first and
explores only what is specific to a change. It is versioned, reviewed by
humans, and limited to 200 lines. Only the orchestrator updates it, at closure,
with a small diff in the same PR. Point to other documents; do not copy them.

This file is still the template. Generate the first version with an initial
Discovery of the project (an N2 task) and review it before relying on it.
Remove the template marker above when it is filled in.

## Structure map

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [TODO: folder] | [TODO: what lives there] |

## Validation commands

| Layer | Command | Cost | When to run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [TODO: backend] | `[TODO: exact command]` | [TODO: seconds or minutes] | [TODO: per slice / closure / CI] |

Mark expensive suites explicitly (for example "full E2E ~13 min: closure or CI
only") so they run once and not per slice.

## Test conventions

- [TODO: where tests live, fixtures or factories, how to mock network calls]

## Environment quirks

- [TODO: slow seeding, fixed ports, test database markers, and how each is handled]

## Pointers

| Document | Read it when |
| --- | --- |
| [TODO: docs/foundations/ARCHITECTURE.md] | [TODO: cross-layer or architectural work] |
